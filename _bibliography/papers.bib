	abstract = {The Columbia Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Center is developing PANACEA, a resource comprising dose-responses and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles of 25 cell lines perturbed with ∼400 clinical oncology drugs, to study a tumor-specific drug mechanism of action. Here, this resource serves as the basis for a DREAM Challenge assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of computational algorithms for de novo drug polypharmacology predictions. Dose-response and perturbational profiles for 32 kinase inhibitors are provided to 21 teams who are blind to the identity of the compounds. The teams are asked to predict high-affinity binding targets of each compound among ∼1,300 targets cataloged in DrugBank. The best performing methods leverage gene expression profile similarity analysis as well as deep-learning methodologies trained on individual datasets. This study lays the foundation for future integrative analyses of pharmacogenomic data, reconciliation of polypharmacology effects in different tumor contexts, and insights into network-based assessments of drug mechanisms of action.},

Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of {\textasciitilde}2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs).

In biomedicine and healthcare, they can represent, for example, molecular interactions, signalling pathways, disease co-morbidities or healthcare systems. In this Perspective, we posit that representation learning can realize principles of network medicine, discuss successes and current limitations of the use of representation learning on graphs in biomedicine and healthcare, and outline algorithmic strategies that leverage the topology of graphs to embed them into compact vectorial spaces. We argue that graph representation learning will keep pushing forward machine learning for biomedicine and healthcare applications, including the identification of genetic variants underlying complex traits, the disentanglement of single-cell behaviours and their effects on health, the assistance of patients in diagnosis and treatment, and the development of safe and effective medicines.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

The current clinical practice for the testing using either Allred score or H-score is still based on laborious manual counting and estimation of the amount and intensity of positively stained cancer cells in immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained slides. This work integrates cell detection and classification workflow for breast carcinoma estrogen receptor (ER)-IHC-stained images and presents an automated evaluation system. The system first detects all cells within the specific regions and classifies them into negatively, weakly, moderately, and strongly stained, followed by Allred scoring for ER status evaluation. The generated Allred score relies heavily on accurate cell detection and classification and is compared against pathologists’ manual estimation. Experiments on 40 whole-slide images show 82.5\% agreement on hormonal treatment recommendation, which we believe could be further improved with an advanced learning model and enhancement to address the cases with 0\% ER status. This promising system can automate the exhaustive exercise to provide fast and reliable assistance to pathologists and medical personnel. The system has the potential to improve the overall standards of prognostic reporting for cancer patients, benefiting pathologists, patients, and also the public at large.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user.

	abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.\&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

To investigate these relationships, we used imaging mass cytometry to quantify the expression of 37 proteins with subcellular spatial resolution in 483 tumors from the METABRIC cohort. Single-cell analysis revealed cell phenotypes spanning epithelial, stromal and immune types. Distinct combinations of cell phenotypes and cell–cell interactions were associated with genomic subtypes of breast cancer. Epithelial luminal cell phenotypes separated into those predominantly impacted by mutations and those affected by copy number aberrations. Several features of tumor ecosystems, including cellular neighborhoods, were linked to prognosis, illustrating their clinical relevance. In summary, systematic analysis of single-cell phenotypic and spatial correlates of genomic alterations in cancer revealed how genomes shape both the composition and architecture of breast tumor ecosystems and will enable greater understanding of the phenotypic impact of genomic alterations.},

There is a desperate need to understand influence of the tumor microenvironment on cancer development and evolution. Applying principles and quantitative methods from ecology can suggest novel solutions to fulfil this need. We discuss spatial heterogeneity as a fundamental biological feature of the microenvironment, which has been largely ignored. Histological samples can provide spatial context of diverse cell types coexisting within the microenvironment. Advanced computer-vision techniques have been developed for spatial mapping of cells in histological samples. This has enabled the applications of experimental and analytical tools from ecology to cancer research, generating system-level knowledge of microenvironmental spatial heterogeneity. We focus on studies of immune infiltrate and tumor resource distribution, and highlight statistical approaches for addressing the emerging challenges based on these new approaches.},

	abstract = {Each tumour represents an independent evolutionary experiment, starting from almost the same point: namely, the fertilized egg. As tools for genome-wide analysis become more widely applied, commonalities and variations in the patterns of cancer evolution are emerging, and this has important implications for our understanding of cancer biology and the management of patients with tumours.Evolution may be investigated within an individual cancer through various sampling approaches, ranging from a single sample to multiple samples taken over space and/or time or even from multiple single cells.Massively parallel sequencing data from bulk tumour sampling lend themselves to mathematical approaches that permit the reconstruction of the underlying genomic architecture.Genomic technologies have identified extreme genomic heterogeneity between and even within tumour types. This suggests that evolutionary pathways underlying cancers are diverse and highlights one of the challenges for the design of cancer therapies.Intratumoural heterogeneity reflects the branching and dynamic nature of cancer evolution.When a new mutation arises in a cancer cell, the subsequent evolutionary trajectory of the cell will be influenced by the cellular ground state and any pre-existing mutations. Understanding epistatic interactions that operate within a cancer cell will contribute to our comprehension of carcinogenesis and is important for designing targeted therapeutic approaches.Emerging observations suggest that cancers do not necessarily arise gradually through multiple steps but that sudden 'crisis' events can accelerate carcinogenesis.Many of the aggressive clinical characteristics of cancer depend on the continued generation of variation. There is evidence for the existence of genomic instability in many cancer types, but it remains unclear whether it is a pre-requisite for cancer development or whether cancers can evolve in the presence of a normal mutation rate.},

	abstract = {Most human cancers exhibit a high degree of intratumour heterogeneity that arises from heritable and stochastic genetic and epigenetic changes, as well as environmental variations within the tumour. Heterogeneous subpopulations that exist within close proximity and compete for limited resources can engage in complex interactions that affect tumorigenesis, disease progression and therapeutic outcomes.Phenotypic changes that arise from subclonal interactions in heterogeneous tumours were observed by cancer biologists very early on. However, as studies mostly focused on cell-autonomous oncogenes and tumour suppressors, investigations into clonal interactions went under the radar for almost three decades. With the increasing recognition of intratumour heterogeneity fuelled by advances in technology, dissecting the mechanistic basis of clonal interactions is now gaining more attention.In addition to the more traditional models that explore clonal interactions strictly from the competitive angle, newer studies are investigating cooperative interactions among subclones that could give rise to novel characteristics and that potentially increase the growth and progression of the tumour.In the absence of proper tools to directly study clonal interactions in patient samples, studies in D. melanogaster, rodents and xenograft systems (using both established cell lines and patient-derived cells) are providing us with mechanistic insights into interclonal crosstalk.Theoretical and mathematical modelling are being used to simulate clonal dynamics under variable circumstances. Although currently far from perfect, these in silico cancer models have already been useful for the design of optimized cancer therapies for the more effective eradication of tumours.Cooperation can be metabolically costly but evolution and survival are more efficient, especially in a changing environment, when diversity and heterogeneity are high. Insights from patient tumours have revealed the presence of multiple independent neoplastic driver subclones that could re-establish tumour heterogeneity after therapy and lead to disease relapse. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence of transient clonal cooperation between neoplastic and benign subclones, which can also lead to tumour recurrence.In order to tackle the ever-evolving populations of tumour cells more effectively and to devise more lasting cures in patients, we must use ecological approaches that take advantage of cooperative tumour-promoting interactions and strategically eliminate them instead of targeting each individual subpopulation.},

This phenotypic heterogeneity is a result of the interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors that shape cellular phenotypes.Genomic instability, which is frequently observed in human cancers, in combination with the large numbers of cell divisions required for the formation of macroscopic tumours, leads to inevitable genetic diversity in populations of tumour cells.Somatic evolution that drives tumour progression is characterized by complex dynamics arising from the Darwinian nature of the process. As a result, individual tumours have a unique clonal architecture that is spatially and temporally heterogeneous.The cancer stem cell perspective can explain only some of the non-genetic variability in tumour cell phenotypes. A more comprehensive explanation of non-genetic sources of phenotypic heterogeneity necessitates the consideration of mechanisms that underlie cellular phenotypes.Both deterministic and stochastic determinants of cellular phenotypes can be substantially affected during oncogenic transformation and tumour progression, contributing both to abnormal phenotypes and to an increased degree of phenotypic plasticity.Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity within tumours impedes clinical diagnostics: owing to topological heterogeneity in the distribution of diagnostically important phenotypes even multiple sampling might not provide adequate information. At the same time, given the link between a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and poor prognosis, a measure of heterogeneity by itself may be useful as a prognostic marker.Phenotypic heterogeneity in tumour cell populations that results from both genetic and non-genetic determinants constitutes a major source of therapeutic resistance. Initial phenotypic heterogeneity and changes in cellular phenotypes resulting from adaptation to response and selection for resistant phenotypes need to be accounted for in order to achieve substantial improvements in therapeutic outcomes.},

State-of-the-art models today do not typically support the manipulation of concepts like "the existence of bone spurs", as they are trained end-to-end to go directly from raw input (e.g., pixels) to output (e.g., arthritis severity). We revisit the classic idea of first predicting concepts that are provided at training time, and then using these concepts to predict the label. By construction, we can intervene on these concept bottleneck models by editing their predicted concept values and propagating these changes to the final prediction. On x-ray grading and bird identification, concept bottleneck models achieve competitive accuracy with standard end-to-end models, while enabling interpretation in terms of high-level clinical concepts ("bone spurs") or bird attributes ("wing color"). These models also allow for richer human-model interaction: accuracy improves significantly if we can correct model mistakes on concepts at test time.},

To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance.},

However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses different aspects of cancer. Many of the attitudes toward cancer today are similar to the popular prejudices that were held about infections before the germ theory was worked out and before the causes of different infections were understood. One of the popular misconceptions about cancer is that it is a single disease. In fact, cancer is a group of many different disorders affecting the different parts of the body, and cancer of one part is quite different from cancer of another part. It is a common belief that cancer is always incurable, but in truth, 70\%–90\% of patients can be completely cured of certain types of cancers. It is also believed that cancer can be transmitted by coming in contact with a cancer patient and that it is caused by dirty living, by knocks or blows, or by tinned foods. Doctors have recognized that lung cancer is associated with cigarette smoking even though they have not completely worked out the combination of chemicals that causes this effect.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The progression and treatment response of cancer largely depends on the complex tissue structure that surrounds cancer cells in a tumour, known as the tumour microenvironment (TME). Recent technical advances have led to the development of highly multiplexed imaging techniques such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), which capture the complexity of the TME by producing spatial tissue maps of dozens of proteins. Combining these multidimensional cell phenotypes with their spatial organization to predict clinically relevant information is a challenging computational task and so far no method has addressed it directly. Here, we propose and evaluate MULTIPLAI, a novel framework to predict clinical biomarkers from IMC data. The method relies on attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs) that integrate both the phenotypic and spatial dimensions of IMC images. In this proof-of- concept study we used MULTIPLAI to predict oestrogen receptor (ER) status, a key clinical variable for breast cancer patients. We trained different architectures of our framework on 240 samples and benchmarked against graph learning via graph kernels. Propagation Attribute graph kernels achieved a class-balanced accuracy of 66.18\% in the development set (N=104) while GNNs achieved a class-balanced accuracy of 90.00\% on the same set when using the best combination of graph convolution and pooling layers. We further validated this architecture in internal (N=112) and external test sets from different institutions (N=281 and N=350), demonstrating the generalizability of the method. Our results suggest that MULTIPLAI captures important TME features with clinical importance. This is the first application of GNNs to this type of data and opens up new opportunities for predictive modelling of highly multiplexed images.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment.Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of “big data” about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.},

However, current research focuses on proposing and evaluating specific architectural designs of GNNs, as opposed to studying the more general design space of GNNs that consists of a Cartesian product of different design dimensions, such as the number of layers or the type of the aggregation function. Additionally, GNN designs are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made to understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a novel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general GNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a given novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing architecture; (3) an efficient and effective design space evaluation method which allows insights to be distilled from a huge number of model-task combinations. Our key results include: (1) A comprehensive set of guidelines for designing well-performing GNNs; (2) while best GNN designs for different tasks vary significantly, the GNN task space allows for transferring the best designs across different tasks; (3) models discovered using our design space achieve state-of-the-art performance. Overall, our work offers a principled and scalable approach to transition from studying individual GNN designs for specific tasks, to systematically studying the GNN design space and the task space. Finally, we release GraphGym, a powerful platform for exploring different GNN designs and tasks.

The core of human cognition lies in the structured, reusable concepts that help us to rapidly adapt to new tasks and provide reasoning behind our decisions. However, existing meta-learning methods learn complex representations across prior labeled tasks without imposing any structure on the learned representations. Here we propose COMET, a meta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learn along human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a joint unstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts into semi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks from diverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, document categorization and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biological domain developed in our work. COMET significantly outperforms strong meta-learning baselines, achieving 6-15\% relative improvement on the most challenging 1-shot learning tasks, while unlike existing methods providing interpretations behind the model's predictions.},

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great prowess in learning representations suitable for numerous graph-based machine learning tasks. When applied to semi-supervised node classification, GNNs are widely believed to work well due to the homophily assumption ("like attracts like"), and fail to generalize to heterophilous graphs where dissimilar nodes connect. Recent works design new architectures to overcome such heterophily-related limitations, citing poor baseline performance and new architecture improvements on a few heterophilous graph benchmark datasets as evidence for this notion. In our experiments, we empirically find that standard graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can actually achieve better performance than such carefully designed methods on some commonly used heterophilous graphs. This motivates us to reconsider whether homophily is truly necessary for good GNN performance. We find that this claim is not quite true, and in fact, GCNs can achieve strong performance on heterophilous graphs under certain conditions. Our work carefully characterizes these conditions, and provides supporting theoretical understanding and empirical observations. Finally, we examine existing heterophilous graphs benchmarks and reconcile how the GCN (under)performs on them based on this understanding.},

	abstract = {The debate around the interpretability of attention mechanisms is centered on whether attention scores can be used as a proxy for the relative amounts of signal carried by sub-components of data. We propose to study the interpretability of attention in the context of set machine learning, where each data point is composed of an unordered collection of instances with a global label. For classical multiple-instance-learning problems and simple extensions, there is a well-defined “importance” ground truth that can be leveraged to cast interpretation as a binary classification problem, which we can quantitatively evaluate. By building synthetic datasets over several data modalities, we perform a systematic assessment of attention-based interpretations. We find that attention distributions are indeed often reflective of the relative importance of individual instances, but that silent failures happen where a model will have high classification performance but attention patterns that do not align with expectations. Based on these observations, we propose to use ensembling to minimize the risk of misleading attention-based explanations.},

	url = {https://openreview.net/forum?id=kAa9eDS0RdO},
	abstract = {Attention is a mechanism that has been instrumental in driving remarkable performance gains of deep neural network models in a host of visual, NLP and multimodal tasks. One additional notable aspect of attention is that it conveniently exposes the ``reasoning'' behind each particular output generated by the model. Specifically, attention scores over input regions or intermediate features have been interpreted as a measure of the contribution of the attended element to the model inference. While the debate in regard to the interpretability of attention is still not settled, researchers have pointed out the existence of architectures and scenarios that afford a meaningful interpretation of the attention mechanism. Here we propose the generalization of attention from low-level input features to high-level concepts as a mechanism to ensure the interpretability of attention scores within a given application domain. In particular, we design the ConceptTransformer, a deep learning module that exposes explanations of the output of a model in which it is embedded in terms of attention over user-defined high-level concepts. Such explanations are {\textbackslash}emph\{plausible\} (i.e.{\textbackslash} convincing to the human user) and {\textbackslash}emph\{faithful\} (i.e.{\textbackslash} truly reflective of the reasoning process of the model). Plausibility of such explanations is obtained by construction by training the attention heads to conform with known relations between inputs, concepts and outputs dictated by domain knowledge. Faithfulness is achieved by design by enforcing a linear relation between the transformer value vectors that represent the concepts and their contribution to the classification log-probabilities. We validate our ConceptTransformer module on established explainability benchmarks and show how it can be used to infuse domain knowledge into classifiers to improve accuracy, and conversely to extract concept-based explanations of classification outputs.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01068},
	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) grading is typically carried out by assessing the degree of gland formation within histology images. To do this, it is important to consider the overall tissue micro-environment by assessing the cell-level information along with the morphology of the gland. However, current automated methods for CRC grading typically utilise small image patches and therefore fail to incorporate the entire tissue micro-architecture for grading purposes. To overcome the challenges of CRC grading, we present a novel cell-graph convolutional neural network (CGC-Net) that converts each large histology image into a graph, where each node is represented by a nucleus within the original image and cellular interactions are denoted as edges between these nodes according to node similarity. The CGC-Net utilises nuclear appearance features in addition to the spatial location of nodes to further boost the performance of the algorithm. To enable nodes to fuse multi-scale information, we introduce Adaptive GraphSage, which is a graph convolution technique that combines multi-level features in a data-driven way. Furthermore, to deal with redundancy in the graph, we propose a sampling technique that removes nodes in areas of dense nuclear activity. We show that modeling the image as a graph enables us to effectively consider a much larger image (around 16\${\textbackslash}times\$ larger) than traditional patch-based approaches and model the complex structure of the tissue micro-environment. We construct cell graphs with an average of over 3,000 nodes on a large CRC histology image dataset and report state-of-the-art results as compared to recent patch-based as well as contextual patch-based techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools in digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and ‘hand-crafted’ feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating AI and machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of AI, including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology.},

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

deemed relevant for the prediction of a learned model. Several saliency methods
have been proposed, often guided by visual appeal on image data. In this work, we
propose an actionable methodology to evaluate what kinds of explanations a given
method can and cannot provide. We find that reliance, solely, on visual assessment
can be misleading. Through extensive experiments we show that some existing
saliency methods are independent both of the model and of the data generating
process. Consequently, methods that fail the proposed tests are inadequate for
tasks that are sensitive to either data or model, such as, finding outliers in the data,
explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs that the model learned,
and debugging the model. We interpret our findings through an analogy with
edge detection in images, a technique that requires neither training data nor model.
Theory in the case of a linear model and a single-layer convolutional neural network

Recent work has shown that (Vision) Transformer models (ViT) can achieve comparable or even superior performance on image classification tasks. This raises a central question: how are Vision Transformers solving these tasks? Are they acting like convolutional networks, or learning entirely different visual representations? Analyzing the internal representation structure of ViTs and CNNs on image classification benchmarks, we find striking differences between the two architectures, such as ViT having more uniform representations across all layers. We explore how these differences arise, finding crucial roles played by self-attention, which enables early aggregation of global information, and ViT residual connections, which strongly propagate features from lower to higher layers. We study the ramifications for spatial localization, demonstrating ViTs successfully preserve input spatial information, with noticeable effects from different classification methods. Finally, we study the effect of (pretraining) dataset scale on intermediate features and transfer learning, and conclude with a discussion on connections to new architectures such as the MLP-Mixer.},

	abstract = {Early detection of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most aggressive malignancies of the pancreas, is crucial to avoid metastatic spread to other body regions. Detection of pancreatic cancer is typically carried out by assessing the distribution and arrangement of tumor and immune cells in histology images. This is further complicated due to morphological similarities with chronic pancreatitis (CP), and the co-occurrence of precursor lesions in the same tissue. Most of the current automated methods for grading pancreatic cancers rely on extensive feature engineering involving accurate identification of cell features or utilising single number spatially informed indices for grading purposes. Moreover, sophisticated methods involving black-box approaches, such as neural networks, do not offer insights into the model’s ability to accurately identify the correct disease grade. In this paper, we develop a novel cell-graph based Cell-Graph Attention (CGAT) network for the precise classification of pancreatic cancer and its precursors from multiplexed immunofluorescence histology images into the six different types of pancreatic diseases. The issue of class imbalance is addressed through bootstrapping multiple CGAT-nets, while the self-attention mechanism facilitates visualization of cell-cell features that are likely responsible for the predictive capabilities of the model. It is also shown that the model significantly outperforms the decision tree classifiers built using spatially informed metric, such as the Morisita-Horn (MH) indices.},

We generate such cell graphs of 1000–3000 cells (nodes) with 2000–10 000 links, each of which is calculated as a decaying exponential function of the Euclidean distance between every pair of cells in accordance with the Waxman model. At the cellular level, we compute the graph metrics of the cell graphs, including the degree, clustering coefﬁcient, eccentricity and closeness for each cell. Working with a total of 285 tissue samples surgically removed from 12 different patients, we demonstrate that the self-organizing clusters of cancerous cells exhibit distinctive graph metrics that distinguish them from the healthy cells and the unhealthy inﬂamed cells at the cellular level with an accuracy of at least 85\%. At the tissue level, we accomplish correct tissue classiﬁcations of cancerous, healthy and nonneoplastic inﬂamed tissue samples with an accuracy of 100\% by requiring correct classiﬁcation for the majority of the cells within the tissue sample.},

	abstract = {Gigapixel medical images provide massive data, both morphological textures and spatial information, to be mined. Due to the large data scale in histology, deep learning methods play an increasingly significant role as feature extractors. Existing solutions heavily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for global pixel-level analysis, leaving the underlying local geometric structure such as the interaction between cells in the tumor microenvironment unexplored. The topological structure in medical images, as proven to be closely related to tumor evolution, can be well characterized by graphs. To obtain a more comprehensive representation for downstream oncology tasks, we propose a fusion framework for enhancing the global image-level representation captured by CNNs with the geometry of cell-level spatial information learned by graph neural networks (GNN). The fusion layer optimizes an integration between collaborative features of global images and cell graphs. Two fusion strategies have been developed: one with MLP which is simple but turns out efficient through fine-tuning, and the other with Transformer gains a champion in fusing multiple networks. We evaluate our fusion strategies on histology datasets curated from large patient cohorts of colorectal and gastric cancers for three biomarker prediction tasks. Both two models outperform plain CNNs or GNNs, reaching a consistent AUC improvement of more than 5\% on various network backbones. The experimental results yield the necessity for combining image-level morphological features with cell spatial relations in medical image analysis.

	abstract = {Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. An accurate prognosis is essential for effective clinical assessment and treatment. Spatial patterns in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are conceptually indicative of the staging and progression of gastric cancer patients. Using spatial patterns of the TME by integrating and transforming the multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images as Cell-Graphs, we propose a graph neural network-based approach, termed Cell−Graph Signature or CGSignature, powered by artificial intelligence, for the digital staging of TME and precise prediction of patient survival in gastric cancer. In this study, patient survival prediction is formulated as either a binary (short-term and long-term) or ternary (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) classification task. Extensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that the CGSignature achieves outstanding model performance, with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.960 ± 0.01, and 0.771 ± 0.024 to 0.904 ± 0.012 for the binary- and ternary-classification, respectively. Moreover, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicates that the “digital grade” cancer staging produced by CGSignature provides a remarkable capability in discriminating both binary and ternary classes with statistical significance (P value {\textless} 0.0001), significantly outperforming the AJCC 8th edition Tumor Node Metastasis staging system. Using Cell-Graphs extracted from mIHC images, CGSignature improves the assessment of the link between the TME spatial patterns and patient prognosis. Our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of such an artificial intelligence-powered digital staging system in diagnostic pathology and precision oncology.},

	abstract = {Spatial arrangement of cells of various types, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the advancing edge of a tumor, are important features for detecting and characterizing cancers. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do not explicitly extract intricate features of the spatial arrangements of the cells from histopathology images. In this work, we propose to classify cancers using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by modeling a tissue section as a multi-attributed multi-relational spatial graph of its constituent cells. Cells are detected using their nuclei in H and E stained tissue image, and each cell’s appearance is captured as a multi-attributed high-dimensional vertex feature. The spatial relations between neighboring cells are captured as edge features based on their distances in a multi-relational graph. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by obtaining classification accuracy that is competitive with CNNs, specifically, Inception-v3, on two tasks – cancerous versus non-cancerous and in situ versus invasive – on the BACH breast cancer dataset.},

	abstract = {We propose to classify intestinal glands as normal or dysplastic using cell-graphs and graph-based deep learning methods. Dysplastic intestinal glands can lead to colorectal cancer, which is one of the three most common cancer types in the world. In order to assess the cancer stage and thus the treatment of a patient, pathologists analyse tissue samples of affected patients. Among other factors, they look at the changes in morphology of different tissues, such as the intestinal glands. Cell-graphs have a high representational power and can describe topological and geometrical properties of intestinal glands. However, classical graph-based methods have a high computational complexity and there is only a limited range of machine learning methods available. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an efficient learning-based approach to classify cell-graphs. We investigate different variants of so-called Message Passing Neural Networks and compare them with a classical graph-based approach based on approximated Graph Edit Distance and k-nearest neighbours classifier. A promising classification accuracy of 94.8\% is achieved by the proposed method on the pT1 Gland Graph dataset, which is an increase of 11.5\% over the baseline result.},

However, popular deep learning methods and explainability techniques (explainers) based on pixel-wise processing disregard biological entities’ notion, thus complicating comprehension by pathologists. In this work, we address this by adopting biological entity-based graph processing and graph explainers enabling explanations accessible to pathologists. In this context, a major challenge becomes to discern meaningful explainers, particularly in a standardized and quantiﬁable fashion. To this end, we propose herein a set of novel quantitative metrics based on statistics of class separability using pathologically measurable concepts to characterize graph explainers. We employ the proposed metrics to evaluate three types of graph explainers, namely the layer-wise relevance propagation, gradientbased saliency, and graph pruning approaches, to explain Cell-Graph representations for Breast Cancer Subtyping. The proposed metrics are also applicable in other domains by using domain-speciﬁc intuitive concepts. We validate the qualitative and quantitative ﬁndings on the BRACS dataset, a large cohort of breast cancer RoIs, by expert pathologists. The code, data, and models can be accessed here1.},

This emerging field has witnessed an extensive growth of promising techniques that have been applied with success to computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. But for any successful field to become mainstream and reliable, benchmarks must be developed to quantify progress. This led us in March 2020 to release a benchmark framework that i) comprises of a diverse collection of mathematical and real-world graphs, ii) enables fair model comparison with the same parameter budget to identify key architectures, iii) has an open-source, easy-to-use and reproducible code infrastructure, and iv) is flexible for researchers to experiment with new theoretical ideas. As of May 2022, the GitHub repository has reached 1,800 stars and 339 forks, which demonstrates the utility of the proposed open-source framework through the wide usage by the GNN community. In this paper, we present an updated version of our benchmark with a concise presentation of the aforementioned framework characteristics, an additional medium-sized molecular dataset AQSOL, similar to the popular ZINC, but with a real-world measured chemical target, and discuss how this framework can be leveraged to explore new GNN designs and insights. As a proof of value of our benchmark, we study the case of graph positional encoding (PE) in GNNs, which was introduced with this benchmark and has since spurred interest of exploring more powerful PE for Transformers and GNNs in a robust experimental setting.},

	abstract = {Cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response predictions from tissue specimens highly depend on the phenotype and topological distribution of constituting histological entities. Thus, adequate tissue representations for encoding histological entities is imperative for computer aided cancer patient care. To this end, several approaches have leveraged cell-graphs that encode cell morphology and organization to denote the tissue information. These allow for utilizing machine learning to map tissue representations to tissue functionality to help quantify their relationship. Though cellular information is crucial, it is incomplete alone to comprehensively characterize complex tissue structure. We herein treat the tissue as a hierarchical composition of multiple types of histological entities from fine to coarse level, capturing multivariate tissue information at multiple levels. We propose a novel multi-level hierarchical entity-graph representation of tissue specimens to model hierarchical compositions that encode histological entities as well as their intra- and inter-entity level interactions. Subsequently, a graph neural network is proposed to operate on the hierarchical entity-graph representation to map the tissue structure to tissue functionality. Specifically, for input histology images we utilize well-defined cells and tissue regions to build HierArchical Cell-to-Tissue (HACT) graph representations, and devise HACT-Net, a graph neural network, to classify such HACT representations. As part of this work, we introduce the BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset, a large cohort of H\&E stained breast tumor images, to evaluate our proposed methodology against pathologists and state-of-the-art approaches. Through comparative assessment and ablation studies, our method is demonstrated to yield superior classification results compared to alternative methods as well as pathologists.},

	abstract = {One way to interpret neural model predictions is to highlight the most important input features—for example, a heatmap visualization over the words in an input sentence. In existing interpretation methods for NLP, a word's importance is determined by either input perturbation—measuring the decrease in model confidence when that word is removed—or by the gradient with respect to that word. To understand the limitations of these methods, we use input reduction, which iteratively removes the least important word from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these counterintuitive results, we draw connections to adversarial examples and confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in interpreting neural models trained with maximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies, we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on reduced examples. Fine-tuned models become more interpretable under input reduction, without accuracy loss on regular examples.},

	abstract = {Attention mechanisms have seen wide adoption in neural NLP models. In addition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted as affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution over attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly) as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work, we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations' for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be treated as though they do.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that `Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model, using a rigorous experimental design. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

	abstract = {Throughout the history of oncology research, tumor heterogeneity has been a major hurdle for the successful treatment of cancer. As a result of aberrant changes in the tumor microenvironment such as high mutational burden, hypoxic conditions and abnormal vasculature, several malignant subpopulations often exist within a single tumor mass. Therapeutic intervention can also increase selective pressure towards subpopulations with acquired resistance. This phenomenon is often the cause of relapse in previously responsive patients, drastically changing the expected outcome of therapy. In the case of cancer immunotherapy, tumor heterogeneity is a substantial barrier as acquired resistance often takes the form of antigen escape and immunosuppression. In an effort to combat intrinsic resistance mechanisms, therapies are often combined as a multi-pronged approach to target multiple pathways simultaneously. These multi-therapy regimens have long been a mainstay of clinical oncology with chemotherapy cocktails but are more recently being investigated in the emerging landscape of immunotherapy. Furthermore, as high throughput technology becomes more affordable and accessible, researchers continue to deepen their understanding of the factors that influence tumor heterogeneity and shape the TME over the course of treatment regimens. In this review, we will investigate the factors that give rise to tumor heterogeneity and the impact it has on the field of immunotherapy. We will discuss how tumor heterogeneity causes resistance to various treatments and review the strategies currently being employed to overcome this challenging clinical hurdle. Finally, we will outline areas of research that should be prioritized to gain a better understanding of tumor heterogeneity and develop appropriate solutions.},

We identified ten recurrent TME structures that varied by vascular content, stromal quiescence versus activation, and leukocyte composition. These TME structures had distinct enrichment patterns among breast cancer subtypes, and some were associated with genomic profiles indicative of immune escape. Regulatory and dysfunctional T cells co-occurred in large ‘suppressed expansion’ structures. These structures were characterized by high cellular diversity, proliferating cells and enrichment for BRCA1 and CASP8 mutations and predicted poor outcome in estrogen-receptor-positive disease. The multicellular structures revealed here link conserved spatial organization to local TME function and could improve patient stratification.},

We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn{\textasciicircum}2) and space O(n{\textasciicircum}2) in the worst case, and in time O(n{\textasciicircum}2log n) and space O(n{\textasciicircum}2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

	abstract = {Feedforward inhibition and synaptic scaling are important adaptive processes that control the total input a neuron can receive from its afferents. While often studied in isolation, the two have been reported to co-occur in various brain regions. The functional implications of their interactions remain unclear, however. Based on a probabilistic modeling approach, we show here that fast feedforward inhibition and synaptic scaling interact synergistically during unsupervised learning. In technical terms, we model the input to a neural circuit using a normalized mixture model with Poisson noise. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that, in the presence of lateral inhibition introducing competition between different neurons, Hebbian plasticity and synaptic scaling approximate the optimal maximum likelihood solutions for this model. Our results suggest that, beyond its conventional use as a mechanism to remove undesired pattern variations, input normalization can make typical neural interaction and learning rules optimal on the stimulus subspace defined through feedforward inhibition. Furthermore, learning within this subspace is more efficient in practice, as it helps avoid locally optimal solutions. Our results suggest a close connection between feedforward inhibition and synaptic scaling which may have important functional implications for general cortical processing.},

	abstract = {The effective reproductive number Re is a key indicator of the growth of an epidemic. Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many methods and online dashboards have sprung up to monitor this number through time. However, these methods are not always thoroughly tested, correctly placed in time, or are overly confident during high incidence periods. Here, we present a method for timely estimation of Re, applied to COVID-19 epidemic data from 170 countries. We thoroughly evaluate the method on simulated data, and present an intuitive web interface for interactive data exploration. We show that, in early 2020, in the majority of countries the estimated Re dropped below 1 only after the introduction of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. For Europe the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions was broadly associated with reductions in the estimated Re. Globally though, relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions had more varied effects on subsequent Re estimates. Our framework is useful to inform governments and the general public on the status of epidemics in their country, and is used as the official source of Re estimates for SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland. It further allows detailed comparison between countries and in relation to covariates such as implemented public health policies, mobility, behaviour, or weather data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) through grant number 31CA30_196267 (to TS), 200021_172603 (to MHM), 310030B_176401 (to SB), and NRP72 grant 407240-167121 (to SB and TS).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No ethics commitee was involved as no clinical trial data was used.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease. Common hallmark features of cancer can be found. Their origin may be traced back to their intricate relationships governing regulatory programs during the development of this disease. To unveil distinctive features of the transcriptional regulation program in breast cancer, a pipeline for RNA-seq analysis in 780 breast cancer and 101 healthy breast samples, at gene expression and network level, was implemented. Inter-chromosomal relationships between genes resulted strikingly scarce in a cancer network, in comparison to its healthy counterpart. We suggest that inter-chromosomal regulation loss may be a novel feature in breast cancer. Additional evidence was obtained by independent validation in microarray and Hi-C data as well as supplementary computational analyses. Functional analysis showed upregulation in processes related to cell cycle and division; while migration, adhesion and cell-to-cell communication, were downregulated. Both the BRCA1 DNA repairing signalling and the Estrogen-mediated G1/S phase entry pathways were found upregulated. In addition, a synergistic underexpression of the γ-protocadherin complex, located at Chr5q31 is also shown. This region has previously been reported to be hypermethylated in breast cancer. These findings altogether provide further evidence for the central role of transcriptional regulatory programs in shaping malignant phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Breast carcinomas are characterized by anomalous gene regulatory programs. As is well known, gene expression programs are able to shape phenotypes. Hence, the understanding of gene co-expression may shed light on the underlying mechanisms behind the transcriptional regulatory programs affecting tumor development and evolution. For instance, in breast cancer, there is a clear loss of inter-chromosomal (trans-) co-expression, compared with healthy tissue. At the same time cis- (intra-chromosomal) interactions are favored in breast tumors. In order to have a deeper understanding of regulatory phenomena in cancer, here, we constructed Gene Co-expression Networks by using 848 RNA-seq whole-genome samples corresponding to the four breast cancer molecular subtypes, as well as healthy tissue. We quantify the cis-/trans- co-expression imbalance in all phenotypes. Additionally, we measured the association between co-expression and physical distance between genes, and characterized the proportion of intra/inter-cytoband interactions per phenotype. We confirmed loss of trans- co-expression in all molecular subtypes. We also observed that gene cisco-expression decays abruptly with distance in all tumors in contrast with healthy tissue. We observed co-expressed gene hotspots, that tend to be connected at cytoband regions, and coincide accurately with already known copy number altered regions, such as Chr17q12, or Chr8q24.3 for all subtypes. Our methodology recovered different alterations already reported for specific breast cancer subtypes, showing how co-expression network approaches might help to capture distinct events that modify the cell regulatory program.},
