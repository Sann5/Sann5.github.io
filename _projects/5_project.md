# What I do
Since August 2023 I am working at the [Food Systems Biotechnology](https://fsb.ethz.ch/) group as a software engineer. My work in this group consist of developing and integrating bioinfomratics tools for metagenome-analysis with [Qiime2](https://qiime2.org/).

Qiime2 is potent microbiome analysis tool that prioritizes transparency and reproducibility. It does so by featuring automated data tracking, a semantic type system, and a plugin system for expanded functionality. 

My responsibilities in the devolving team include:
- ðŸ”§ adding new functionalities to already existing plugins
- ðŸ‘€ reviewing issues and PRs

For example I recently added BUSCO to the [q2-moshpit](https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-moshpit) plugin (Manni, 2021). BUSCO is a tool to quantify the quality of assembled metagenomes based on the presence of universal single-copy orthologues. The goal was to build a wrapper for the existing tool to make it available within Qiime2. Furthermore we sought to present the results through costume interactive visualizations like [this one](/assets/html/busco_example/index.html).

    </div>
