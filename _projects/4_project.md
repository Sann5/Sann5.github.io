## Abstract
Structural variants (SVs) are a very pervasive type of mutations present across cancers. Plenty of research has been done exploring how these aberrations affect differential expression and genomic architecture. However little research has been done concerning the overall effect of this type of mutations in the transcriptional regulatory programs. Building on the work of GarcÃ­a-CortÃ©s et al. (2018) and Espinal-EnrÃ­quez et al. (2017), we ask whether genes that are significantly copy number mutated are enriched in subtype specific breast cancer mutual information transcriptional networks. 

We use the TCGA breast cancer data to build the networks with ARACNE and to determine which genes are significantly copy number mutated in each subtype using GISTIC2.0 (Mermel et al. 2011; Margolin et al. 2006). Then we perform two sided fisher tests enrichment analysis to determine whether these genes are over or under represented in our cancer transcriptional networks. Furthermore, we explore the question of whether these types of mutations could be shaping the observed network architecture. This question however is discussed but not addressed formally.

Nodes dyed blue if said gene were found to be significantly deleted and red if significantly amplified.
